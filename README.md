# Auto Proxy Fetcher

A tool for automatically fetching proxy servers and updating `proxies.txt` using GitHub Actions. You can either use my existing proxy list or set up your own version of this repository.

## Using the Proxy List 

You can directly use the proxy list generated by this tool for your own programs, scripts, or applications. The proxy list is updated every 6 hours and is accessible via this URL (time in GMT 0):

```bash
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VolkanSah/Auto-Proxy-Fetcher/refs/heads/main/proxies.txt
```


### Example Usage

You can use `curl` to download the proxy list directly:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VolkanSah/Auto-Proxy-Fetcher/refs/heads/main/proxies.txt -o proxies.txt
```

Or, you can integrate it into a Python script:

```python
import requests

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VolkanSah/Auto-Proxy-Fetcher/refs/heads/main/proxies.txt"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    with open('proxies.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write(response.text)
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch proxies: {response.status_code}")
```

## Why Every 6 Hours?

Proxies, especially reliable ones, don't change frequently. Therefore, fetching proxies every 6 hours is optimal because:

- **Stability:** Trusted proxy sources update less frequently.
- **Efficient Use of Resources:** By fetching every 6 hours, GitHub Actions minutes are conserved.
- **Rate Limiting Prevention:** Regular fetching avoids triggering rate limits on the proxy sources.
- **Server Load:** It helps reduce the load on the proxy provider servers, ensuring better service for all users.

## How to Set Up Your Own Version

If you want to use this tool on your own GitHub account and customize the workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to the [Auto Proxy Fetcher Repository](https://github.com/VolkanSah/Auto-Proxy-Fetcher).
   - Click on the "Fork" button to create a copy on your own GitHub account.

2. **Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - In your forked repository, go to the "Actions" tab.
   - The workflow should be automatically enabled.
   - You can manually start it by clicking the "Run workflow" button.

3. **Automatic Updates:**
   - The workflow will automatically run every 6 hours.
   - It will update `proxies.txt` with the latest proxy list and commit it to your repository.

By following these steps, you'll have your own proxy fetching tool running on GitHub Actions with customized settings.
